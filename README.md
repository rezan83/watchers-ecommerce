# Watchers.

## Installation


you have two different folders:

1. `api:` where your backend lives

2. `client:` Frontend of your application

To install, you need to go to both directories and install their packages as such:

```bash
cd api
npm install
```

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

To run the `frontend` make sure you are under the client folder and:

````bash
npm start
````

To run the `backend` make sure you are under the api folder and:

````bash
npm run start:dev
````
